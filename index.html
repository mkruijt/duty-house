            <p>
                Duties have been considered boring for too long.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it is about the laundry, cooking or homework.<br />
                It is important to <b>get things done</b>. But what about <b>the rewards</b>?

            <h1>🏅 Keep track of what you <span>achieve</span>!</h1>
            <p>
                We want to keep stuff simple, that is why we build on top of <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">spreadsheets</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reasons we trust you to understand soft rules rather of enforcing with a fancy role base
                system.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not about <b>winning</b>, it is about <b>achieving</b>.

                We build on top of Googles Api and we don't store any of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data is yours... and Google's 🙃
            </p>
            <p>
                You can already use the build-in Google Spreadsheet sharing options so you can:
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the spreadsheet private for yourself and your family</li>
                <li>Make the spreadsheet public and give edit options to who you trust</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If Google is a no-go for you, we're sorry we currently don't have a solution for your case.<br />
